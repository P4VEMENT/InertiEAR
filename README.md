# InertiEAR

This repository includes IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) data collected form 12 smartphones. 

We play speech signals from [AudioMNIST](https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST) using on-board top/bottom speaker of target smartphones and collect IMU readings sampled at 200Hz by default in background. The data can be download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F3sqTJizDdIAYeP1EQqgGDxFG46y-7Wf?usp=sharing).

Due to security issues and requirements from certain companies, we could not release the code at this time. The code will be released in the future.
